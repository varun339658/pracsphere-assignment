# PracSphere - Internship Assignment

This is my submission for the Student Developer Assignment Test from Shel-B Technologies Private Limited. The project is a secure Task Manager Dashboard built as a TurboRepo monorepo using pnpm workspaces.

It is built using the required modern tech stack: Next.js 15 (App Router), NextAuth, MongoDB, and Tailwind CSS.

## ‚ú® Features

* **Secure Authentication**: Implemented user signup and login pages using NextAuth.js with a Credentials Provider. All dashboard routes are protected and accessible only after a successful login.

* **Monorepo Architecture**: The project follows the required TurboRepo + pnpm structure, separating the Next.js `web` app from shared `ui` and `config` packages.

* **Responsive Dashboard Layout**: A clean, responsive layout featuring the required Sidebar (with links to Dashboard, Tasks, Profile, and Logout) and a persistent Topbar.

* **Full Task Management (CRUD)**: Logged-in users can manage their own personal tasks. This includes:

   * **Create**: Adding new tasks with a title, description, and due date.

   * **Read**: Viewing all tasks in a card or table format.

   * **Update**: Marking tasks as "complete" or "pending".

   * **Delete**: Removing tasks from the list.

* **Task Filtering**: The interface includes functionality to filter tasks by their status (All, Completed, or Pending).

* **Secure Database**: Uses MongoDB with separate `users` and `tasks` collections. Passwords are securely hashed using `bcrypt`, and all task operations are scoped to the logged-in user.
